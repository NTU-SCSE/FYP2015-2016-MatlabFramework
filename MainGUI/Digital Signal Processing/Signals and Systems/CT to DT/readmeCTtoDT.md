<h2>Continuous-Time to Discrete-Time Signal</h2>

<p>The Continuous-time Signal x(t) to Discrete-time Signal x[n] app is an application that allows to create a set of periodic continuous time signals and convert to discrete time signals.</p>

<p>The features: </p>
<li>Users can change the input frequency and sampling rate values.</li>
<li>Able to show the value of x[n] on the graph.</li>
