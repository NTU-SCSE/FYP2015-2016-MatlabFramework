<h2>Discrete-Time Convolution</h2>

<p>The Discrete-time Convolution app is an application that helps visualize the process of discrete-time convolution. 
The features are:
<l1>Users can choose from a variety of different signals: sine, cosine, exponential, pulse, unit sample and user signal.</l1>
<l2>Users can observe in the multiplication and the linear convolution graph as the n input value is being shifted.</l2>
<13>Various plot options enable the tool to be effectively used as a lecture aid in a classroom environment.</l3>
