<h2>Discrete-Time Convolution</h2>

<p>The Discrete-time Convolution app is an application that helps visualize the process of discrete-time convolution. </p>
</p>
The features are:
<li>Users can choose from a variety of different signals: sine, cosine, exponential, pulse, unit sample and user signal.</li>
<li>Users can observe in the multiplication and the linear convolution graph as the n input value is being shifted.</li>
<li>Various plot options enable the tool to be effectively used as a lecture aid in a classroom environment.</li>
