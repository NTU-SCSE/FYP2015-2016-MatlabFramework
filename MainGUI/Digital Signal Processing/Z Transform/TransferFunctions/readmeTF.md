<h2>Transfer Functions</h2>

<p>The Transfer Function app is an application that allows user to visualize the impulse response and the unit step response from the input of zeros and poles.</p>

<p>The features:</p>

<li>Provides results from a step input, impulse input and diagrams of Root Locus, Bode, and Nyquist. </li>
<li>Able to see multi-results of the transfer function that user insert. </li>
<li>Shows the math equation of the transfer function on the figure. </li>
<li>Furthermore, users can zoom in/out on the figure by using 'max' button.</li>
