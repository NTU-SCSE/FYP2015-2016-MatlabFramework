<h1>Fourier Series Animation</h2>

<p>The Fourier series animation version 1 is an application demonstrating Fourier series representation of periodic signals. The Fourier series animation version 2 is an application demonstrating Fourier series representation of periodic signals as a sum of sinusoidal functions</p>
<p>The features of the two apps:</p>
<li>Users can change the period, amplitude and frequency values.</li>
<li>Simple animation that only plays when the play button is pressed.</li>
